# Hydrolix terraform scripts

This repository contains modular terraform scripts for provisioning a Kubernetes clusters for deploying Hydrolix. More cloud providers will be added.

Each provider has a number of environments that are used to build different scales of deployment i.e dev. staging. production and any variations. Navigate to an environment and run terraform from there. Each are independant of each others terraform state, allowing you to run different configurations at the same time.
